# Survival Analysis Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on survival analysis in the telecommunications industry, specifically investigating customer churn behavior. Survival analysis techniques are employed to model the time until an event of interest (in this case, customer churn) occurs.

## Author
- **Name:** Nane Mambreyan

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build and compare accelerated failure time (AFT) models using various distribution families to predict customer churn. Additionally, the project aims to analyze the significant predictors influencing churn risk and calculate customer lifetime value (CLV) to inform retention budget allocation.

## Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Building AFT models using different distribution families
- Comparing model performance based on various criteria
- Visualizing survival curves for different distributions
- Identifying significant predictors influencing churn risk
- Calculating CLV for individual customers
- Analyzing CLV distribution across different customer segments
- Determining the retention budget based on the number of at-risk customers

## Dependencies
This project utilizes several R packages, including:
- ggplot2
- dplyr
- survival
- survminer
- ggpubr
- knitr
- and others (see code for full list)

## Usage
To reproduce the analysis:
1. Ensure all necessary R packages are installed.
2. Download the provided dataset ('telco.csv') or replace it with your own data.
3. Run the R script ('survival_analysis.R') in your preferred R environment.

## Results
The project provides insights into customer churn behavior in the telecommunications industry, identifies significant predictors influencing churn risk, calculates CLV for individual customers, and determines the retention budget based on the number of at-risk customers.

## Conclusion
The project concludes by offering recommendations for retention strategies, such as personalized communication, enhanced customer experience, and targeted promotional campaigns, to minimize churn and maximize customer lifetime value.
